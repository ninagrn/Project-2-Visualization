     			<p>
         			<img src="map.jpg" style="float:left" width = '700' height = '400'/>
				The world map shows the number of events across the different countries. The user can click any 
				country and adjust both the sunburst Stream chart to the selected countries.

		 <h3>Sunburst</h3>
      			
     			<p>
         			<img src="sunburst.jpg" style="float:left"/>
				The sunburst shows the distribution among the different target types with the following main categories:
				Military/Police/Government, Civilians, Infrastructure, Terrorists, and Other. Each of them shows the distribution of different subtypes at the outer ring of the Sunburst.  

      			</p>

		 <h3>Stream Chart</h3>
      			
     			<p>
         			<img src="streamchart.jpg" style="float:left" width = '700' height = '400'/>
				The stream chart shows the use of several types of weapons used over time categorized in three groups: Explosives& Incendiary, Guns, and others. The first two categories 
				are shown on the positive y-Axis while ‘Other’ is shown on the negative y-Axis. The chart can be read similarly to a stacked bar chart where ‘Explosives& Incendiary’ is stacked
				on top of ‘Guns.’ The user can browse over the chart to get more information about the different datapoints. The user can also click one of the weapon types to adjust the other
				two charts by weapon type as well.

         			<img src="scatterplot.jpg" style="float:left" width = '700' height = '400'/>
				There are two scatterplots. The right scatterplot shows the relationship between average hostages released by country and the average ransom difference (Demanded vs paid). The size 
				of the datapoint indicates the number of events per million citizens. The left scatterplot shows the relationship between the average perp taken in custody by country versus average
				hostage rescue rate by country. The size of the datapoint is to read as in the first scatterplot.
