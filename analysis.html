				The Global Terrorism Database™ (GTD) is an open-source database includes information on terrorist events around the world from the year 1970 to 2020. The data is vast in terms of length and breadth, for this analysis a subset of data focuses on hostage situations, outcomes and success is sliced to answer questions of
			 	interest to this group. Most of the data was a capture of many sources and methodology, we ran through multiple iterations of the data transformation to fit requirements for the visualization. The current dashboard is built to answer the initial questions and may be updated to fit future scope (e.g.: Ransome, Hijacking ).
			 	The consumer of this report can be a head of state or strategist planning to avoid unpleasant circumstances and successful outcomes for operation of such kinds.

				When we first started the project, we planned on using the whole range of terrorism attacks. Therefore, we planned on showing the world map and have a heat map representing the number of countries in each country. We wanted to add filters for three different categories: Types of Targets, type of attacks, and type of perps. Additionally, we wanted to add a time line chart where each attack was documented on the time line. An outline of that can be observed in the image below. 
			 	Additionally, we wanted the three main categories as well as the time line to act as a filter.

				Before we started with the first visualization, we used Tableau Prep to clean the data further and gain a better understanding of the data at hand. A screenshot of the interface used can be seen below.<br>

				First Implementation of Idea:
                   <br> <br>
			 <div align=center>
                   <img src="design1.jpg"width = '500'height = auto> <br><br>

                 <p style="margin-left:12%; margin-right:12%; font-size:13px">
			 <br>
			 
				The first implementation was a simple world map where each country was color coded according to the number of events. We then added international hijackings as lines connected to point those events out. However, after further testing and talking to others, we decided that this implementation is not easily readable or interpretable and therefore 
			 	decided to take a different route. We filtered all the events for only hostage event as described in the Section ‘Data and Data Preprocessing’ and thought about new ways to visualize the data. We wanted to keep the world map as the main graph and thought about different plots that would add value to the visualization. After further deliberation, we decided
			 	that we wanted to have a timeline plot for the weapon use over time and a scatter plot for the Target types.We decided to use a stream chart for the weapon types over time plot, but we had issues to make the scatterplot meaningful. We decided to add a simple bar chart for ransom demanded versus ransom paid to add more information. At this point we started to 
			 	link the different graphs together such that we could analyze different regions and countries better and also be able to compare them.A first implementation of that idea can be seen in the picture below.

                   <br> <br>
			 <div align=center>
                   <img src="design2.jpg"width = '500'height = auto> <br><br>
				 </div>

               <br> <br> </p>
                 <p style="margin-left:12%; margin-right:12%; font-size:13px">
			 <br>
			 
				Since we struggled to come up with a scatter plot fir the target types, we decided to use a sunburst instead to show the distribution and proportion among the target types and their subcategories. At the same time, we wanted to focus
			 	on more than just the number of events, target types, and weapons used. Another interesting aspect that we wanted to focus on were
			 	the people involved in the hostage situation: the hostages and the perpetuators. We decided to use two kind of visualizations for this purpose: butterfly graphs and scatterplots. The butterfly graphs were chosen because it shows data
			 	symmetric and is an ideal choice to compare two similar  distributions.<br><br>
			 	We started with trying to compare perps to hostages but the counts were drastically different for each so we went with two aspects of the same quantity (perps). Doctrinally, foreign fighters play by a very different set of rules than domestic
			 	fighters. So we looked at the number of foreign fighters per million people. Next, we tried to think of the next most interesting aspect of the nature of the perps. We decided to look at how many perps were involved in murdering their hostages.
			 	The variance from country was very interesting. These perp trends made me want to add GDP or some other economic measures to the analysis.We implemented the same idea twice with the difference that one butterfly graph shows the distribution per region
			 	and the second shows the top 5 country for a selected region.
				Because the butterfly charts on the top of the dashboard offer analysis of the nature of the perps, we decided to do a similar but different deep dive on the nature of the terrorism response forces by region and country. That is why we
			 	used one scatterplot to consider at a two axis measure of the quality of the response forces. Given the data available, the best measure of response force success is how often they capture perps and rescue hostages. The countries in the upper
			 	right corner of the scatterplot are successful along both designated dimensions. The countries in the lower left are unsuccessful along both dimensions.<br><br>
			 	All measures are normalized by dividing the counts per capita, then multiplying 
			 	the resultant by 1,000,000. We chose this number to scale the resultant because we wanted the actual value to be relevant to the user. Without multiplying by 1,000,000, the vast majority of the values are small fractions. Users have a
			 	hard time imagining a fraction of a person. The other scatterplot looks at the efficacy of ransoms. The y axis is the average difference between ransom demanded and ransom paid.
			 	The x axis is the average number of hostages released by the perpetrators. What we find is that, in general, the more the perps were paid, i.e. the lower the difference between ransom demanded and paid, the more hostages were released. That is why we see patterns of clusters of markers along the x axis. The implementation can be shown below.<br>	

                   <br> <br>
			 <div align=center>
                   <img src="design3.jpg"width = '500'height = auto> <br><br>

                 <p style="margin-left:12%; margin-right:12%; font-size:13px">
			 <br>
			 
				Once we had both dashboards completed, we started testing and came across an issue. When selecting certain countries with little or no data for the weapon types, the stream chart was hard to read which might lead to more confusion rather than giving insights. The image below shows an example of such issue when selecting the country Germany. To erase this issue,
			 	we switched plans and went with a plot that shows data in a similar way stacked way as the stream chart does and went with a simpler version of that: a stacked bar plot.


                   <br> <br>
			 <div align=center>

                 <p style="margin-left:12%; margin-right:12%; font-size:12px">
			 <br>
			 
				At this point, we were satisfied with the visualization at hand. We went with two slides for the visualization, the first page being the world map with the stacked bar plot and the sunburst, and the butterfly and scatterplots on the second slide. After this, we focussed on optimizing the visualizations. We implemented a refresh button on the top center and used 
			 	optimizers to check for accessibility for people with any kind of vision disability. We also implemented more information in the tool tips such as a zoom of the country browsed over on the world map, the numerical percentages in the sunburst tooltip, and also added a tooltip for the bar chart.

			To support visualization and latency, we decided to enhance the length and breadth of the data. The process includes uploading a flat file to Microsoft SQL server and working the data from that point. Logically columns were reduced to fit our scope of study and important field that will help answer the initial questions. 
			Data processing includes converting date field and number field to significant digits.
			<br>
			Country names were standardized to fit the current nomenclature and international boundaries. Flags (-99) available within the data set were converted to Null. Multiple flags to support visualization and capture purpose or outcome of the event. 
			Total hostage and total perp had to be adjusted in some cases where the total was less than the sum of parts, in which case the total was re-assigned the sum of its parts. For example, if there were 24 hostages but 25 hostages were killed, the total hostage count would be changed to 25.  Regions are assumed to be culturally 
			and politically more similar to each other than to countries outside their region. Some regions were aggregated (East Asia and South Asia were combined into Asia) due to low variance demonstrating they were essentially from the same group.
			<br>
			Some countries and regions were excluded entirely due to these events being so rare 
			that it did not warrant consideration within the limited space of a dashboard. For example, we dropped Oceania, a region including Australia, New Zealand, and a few other island nations. The entire region only had a couple hostage events, so it was excluded. Similarly, Qatar had a single incident where the one hostage was rescued, and one terrorist was captured. This single event causes a visually significant change in hostage rescue to perpetrator capture scatterplot. Tableau did not validate a few country names and the latitude and longitude provided in the data set were exact location. For this study we did not choose to keep that granularity of the event to infer any internal geographic tensions. Country names were corrected or replaced with current day names for Tableau to recognize current boundaries. Country population data additionally was inserted as a denominator to the calculated fields in tableau.

     				Weapons were summarized to logical bucketing for the simplicity of the visualization (refer data grouping) Spike in events seen post 2014. There is delta increase in use of weaponry type which explains the events following the major events during the period.<br><br>

			 
		<b>1a. Which countries seem to contribute to the spike?</b><br>
		  		The Iraqi Civil war (beginning 2013), War in Northwest Pakistan (Operation Ghazi), Second Libyan Civil War, Boko Haram insurgency contributes to the spike to this weapon type.<br><br>

<!-- Question 2-->
	</p>
       <h5 style="margin-left:12%; margin-right:12%;" >2. Is there a trend for the number of Attacks over time?</h5>
       <p style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:12%; justify-content:center; font-size:13px">
	       The number of attacks increased post 2014. Which are mainly the Iraqi Civil war (beginning 2013), War in Northwest Pakistan (Operation Ghazi), Second Libyan Civil War, Boko Haram insurgency.<br><br> 
	  <b>2a. The increase in events post 2014 affect a specific target type or region?</b> <br>
	       Again, majority of the target type affected where civilian during the time frame 2014- 2018 spread out across the same geography – India, Iraq, Afghanistan. We need to note our data is a subset of hostages flag created based on the data. <br><br>
		<b>2b. Is there a region prone where mliitary was a target type (military) - 2014 to 2018?</b><br>
		Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Yemen are prone to more events targeting military in the area.<br>
		Which region are prone where government was a target type(2014 to 2018)? : Afghanistan, Pakistan India, Libya, Nigeria, Yemen and Iraq.<br><br> 
		<b>2c. How is the Target type spread during the period 2014-2018 ?</b><br>
		The target type in terms of number events is led by Civilians, followed by Police, Militiary, government and others.<br><br>
		</p>
	  
<!-- Question 3-->	  
	  
       <h5 style="margin-left:12%; margin-right:12%;" >3. Is there a relationship looking at the granularity of the events in the country view (tooltip)? </h5>
       <p style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:12%; justify-content:center; font-size:13px">
	 Looking at countries with dense events occurred. Below are few findings - <br>
	Afghanistan is the country with most events in the timeline the data is captured. <br>
	Iraq – The Civil War and Iraq war recorded many events during this time frame. Turkey that shares borders with Iraq see an overflow of event in the border region.<br> 
	India - Events are concentrated at borders shared by Pakistan, China and Bangladesh. <br> 
	Pakistan is the country that shares borders with Afghanistan which also see large number of overspill of events in the region where boundaries are shared.<br> 
	The above relation show that countries that shares borders tend to see more terrorist event near share borders.<br><br> 
	<b>3a. Can we imply the same for countries that share region with Indian ocean?</b><br>
	Yemen and Somalia see the problem of piracy which common on the coast shared by Yemen and Somalia, which records ~ 1200 events in these region <br><br>
	<b>3b. Yemen and Somalia countries attack which target type for the events captured?</b><br> 
	Civilians followed by Military are targeted by these events around the Indian ocean.<br><br> 
	<b>3c. When did the piracy issue increase and what were the weaponry type?</b> <br>
	The piracy volume of events increased 2013 onwards and it is know that these countries do not use advanced weaponry for the attacks, which is confirmed looking at the large category of other category used for the attack.<br>
	</p>
  <br>

<!-- Question 4-->
       <h5 style="margin-left:12%; margin-right:12%;" >4. Is there a region prone to a weapon type (Event >1000)?</h5>
       <p style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:12%; justify-content:center; font-size:13px">
	  India the mix of weapon type is balanced used in the terrorist event. Afghanistan visually has more events use Explosive and Incendiary which confirms the multiple blast and bombing during the timeframe. Year 2014 shows the onset of the Iraqi civil war which confirms a spike in weaponry used and events in Iraq. In the year 1997 violence in Colombia accounted for the bulk of international terrorist incidents in Latin America. <br>
	</p>
<!-- Question 5-->
  <br>
       <h5 style="margin-left:12%; margin-right:12%;" >5. Is there a region with significant high or low foreign perpetrators? </h5>
       <p style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:12%; justify-content:center; font-size:13px">
	  Across all the region, South Asia has the most foreign numbers, but also the most perpetrators overall. While the Middle East& North Africa, South America, and Central& East Asia all have high numbers for perpetrators overall, the proportion of foreign perpetrators is extremely low.<br> <br> 
	<b>5a. Is there a country with significant high or low foreign perpetrators?</b><br> 
	Namibia shows an enormous proportion of foreign perpetrators. Almost 99% of perpetrators are foreign. Macedonia and Malta show similar distributions as Namibia. Bhutan is another country that shows a high percentage of foreign perpetrators. 
	In contrast, nearly all perpetrators from Sudan, South Sudan, and Somalia are mostly domestic. We can observe similar trends in Afghanistan and Nepal which is interesting since the overall number of perpetrators is extremely high in both countries due to the ongoing wars and internal conflicts. 	
  <br>
<!-- Question 6-->
	</p>
       <h5 style="margin-left:12%; margin-right:12%;" >6.How likely is it for a perp to kill a hostage?</h5>
       <p style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:12%; justify-content:center; font-size:13px">
	  <b>6a. Across regions?</b> <br>
	South Asia has the most homicidal terrorists, but it is to consider that South Asia has the highest number of perpetrators overall as well. Proportion wise, around 30% of the South Asian perpetrators are also murderers. In comparison, nearly 50% of all perpetrators in the Middle East & North Africa are homicidal. Europe and North America show the lowest proportion of homicidal terrorists. <br><br>
 	<b>6b.Across countries?</b> <br>  
	There are some interesting observations when focusing on the countries instead of just the regions. In South Asia, two countries, Afghanistan and Bhutan, have a high percentage of homicidal terrorists. Nepal on the other hand, only has a small percentage of homicidal terrorists even though the total number of perpetrators is high. In the middle East and North Africa, most countries have a relative low percentage of homicidal terrorist except for Syria.<br><br> 
	<b>6c.Is there a relationship to foreign perps?</b> <br>
	On a regional level, we were not able to observe any particular trends, but once we compared them on a country level, we were able to make some interesting observations. As previously mentioned, Afghanistan and Bhutan both have a high percentage of homicidal terrorists. However, while most terrorists in Afghanistan are domestic, most perpetrators are foreign in Bhutan. Syria, another country with a high homicidal terrorist percentage shows a similar trend to Afghanistan. <br>
		Ecuador has a high percentage of foreign perpetrators, but a small number of homicidal perpetrators. Other countries with a high foreign perpetrator rate such as Namibia, Kenya, and Macedonia, support that trend as well. Therefore, we can conclude that there are no indicators that foreign perpetrators increase the rate of homicidal terrorists.<br>

       <h5 style="margin-left:12%; margin-right:12%;" >7. Does paying the demanded ransom save hostage lives?</h5>
       <p style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:12%; justify-content:center; font-size:13px">
	   <b>7a. Are there any trends for certain regions and their countries? </b><br>
	We can observe a common trend of paying the demanded ransom in the South Asian countries. However, most countries are not able to rescue more than 20% of the hostages' lives. A similar trend can be observed in the Middle East and North Africa. Even though most countries tend to pay the demanded ransom, the average hostage saved is around 30 percent. It seems that in both regions paying the ransom barely works to save the hostages. This trend can be seen in Sub-Saharan Africa as well.<br> 
	Two countries in Central and East Asia show a different insight: both the Philippines and Malaysia paid on average 3 million less in ransom and were able to save nearly 50% of the hostages. Another interesting outlier is Greece: Even though they have an average of circa 30 million in unpaid ransom, they were able to rescue close to 80% of the hostages.<br>

	<b>7b. Does the number of events in the country have an influence?</b><br> 
	While we couldn’t confirm any trends for certain, looking at the example images below, that countries with a high number of events seem to have a lower average rate of released hostages. <br>

<!-- Question 8-->
       <h5 style="margin-left:12%; margin-right:12%;" >8. Do countries take perpetrators in custody?</h5>
       <p style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:12%; justify-content:center; font-size:13px">
	  Overall, most countries do not take perpetrators into custody. However, this does not mean that no country attempts to. A possibility for this overall trend could be explained by considering that most countries also cannot rescue a high percentage of hostages even when the demanded ransom is paid. This could mean that for many perpetrators it is not just about the money or that negotiations of any kind seem to fail. <br><br> 
	<b>8a. Does the number of events play a role in this?</b> <br>
	There is no indication that the number of events play a huge role in this on a global scale. Looking only at European countries, however, it can be observed that the countries with a smaller number of events take more perpetrators into custody.  
	<br> <br>
	<b>8b. Does taking perpetrators into custody safe Lifes?</b> <br>
	Overall, we could not see any trend. In the contrary, it seems to have no apparent influence at all. The below picture shows a good example of that. Many countries have an average rate of captured terrorist of almost 0%, but the average rate of rescued hostages ranges from 0 to a 100%. Similarly, even though China can capture circa 35% of the terrorists, they can only save around 20% of the hostages. Amenia takes as many terrorists in custody as China but achieves to rescue 50% of the hostages.
